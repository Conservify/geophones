#+TITLE:  README for glacier
#+EMAIL:  jacob@conservify.org 

This repository contains the hardware and software design for a two station
geophone/accelerometer glacier installation. There are two stations connected
via a point-to-point wireless link. The "glacier" station houses the sensors and
the "lodge" station houses the internet communications.

** Hardware
   This is a description of the hardware components. For wiring/connection diagrams see below.

***** Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2
      https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=sr_1_1
      
      See 'Software' section for a description of the operating system and daemons/services/etc...

***** External USB HDD
      http://wdlabs.wd.com/products/wd-pidrive-berryboot-edition/
      
      Provides 1TB of extra storage.

***** USB To Ethernet Adapter
      Provides two extra USB ports as well as the Ethernet port for the Proxim.

***** Power Bus Board
      This board consolidates a fuse as well as supplying connections for
      various voltage regulators. Fewer of the on-board regulator positions
      ended up being used as power consumption and plans changed.

      The schematics and PCB for this board are in the ~power-bus/hardware~ directory.

      Attached to this board are:
      1) 1 12V 2A voltage regulators (for powering a monitor during maintenance tasks and Obsidian)
         https://www.pololu.com/product/2577
      2) 1 5V 3A voltage regulators, soldered in place.
         https://www.amazon.com/1PCS-Converter-Regulator-Power-CPT-UL-1/dp/B075KCLDBC
      3) A 12V 3A regulator (mounted below) 
         https://www.powerstream.com/DC3611.htm

***** Power Control Board
      This board is used to turn on/off external devices, specifically the Proxim and the Internet (via a Relay)
      The schematics and PCB for this board are in the ~hardware/power-control~ directory. These can be ordered from OshPark.

***** RockBlock+ and USB to RS232 Adapter
      http://www.rock7mobile.com/products-rockblock-plus

      This is used for emergency communications and status updates when there is
      no connectivity. It is wired to the Pi directly, now. Eventually the plan
      was to introduce a MCU that's always powered and could possibly trigger
      restarts, etc...

***** Proxim Wireless Station
      http://www.proxim.com/products/point-to-multipoint/tsunami-mp-10100-series

      See Proxim Wireless section for details.

***** MorningStar Solar Charge Controller, Modbus to RS232 Adapter, and RS232 to USB Adapter
      https://www.amazon.com/Morningstar-PS-MPPT-40M-Prostar-Charge-Controller/dp/B01N2773O8/ref=sr_1_1

      See MorningStar Charge Controller section for details.

***** Batteries (x24)
***** AC Battery Charger
      http://www.xantrex.com/power-products/battery-chargers/truecharge-2.aspx

      This charges the batteries off the generator power that's available during Lodge operating hours.

***** Internet Provider's box and AC Inverter
      https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-300W-Power-Inverter-Adapter/dp/B004MDXS0U/ref=sr_1_19

      It might be possible in the future to run the Internet directly from the
      DC, unfortunately we learned the power details related to this box too
      late to get that in.

** Software
***** Operating System - Tiny Core Linux (piCore-9.0.03)
      The process for generating the images on the SD cards is automated and directions can be found under the ~tce/~ subdirectory.

***** Tunneller:
      1) SSH - provides a backup SSH mechanism, allowing a user to ssh to a local port on the AWS server to ssh to the station.
      2) rsyslog - forwards rsyslog messages to the AWS server.

* Monitoring AWS Server
  Can be a small instance, even free tier. This is only used to aggregate logs for monitoring and serve as a location for backup SSH tunnels to originate.
  
* Proxim Wireless
** Power
   The Proxim wireless can be powered using 12V DC (max 3A) over the 12V/Access
   Port. There are directions in the Proxim documentation for creating an RJ11
   cable to provide this power. This cable is then connected to the 12V 3A
   voltage regulator.

** Hardware/Installation
   Antenna is mounted to the side of the Laundry building at the lodge and was
   aligned using the Proxim aiming dongle. This dongle is connected to the
   12V/Access Port and emits a tone at a frequency that indicates how good the
   alignment is. Because the 12V/Access Port is how we power the device in
   standard operation aiming is done while running on AC power using a PoE
   injector.

   The Proxim station has an internal heater and can be mounted outside. A log
   of it's temperature is also available in the UI.

   The unit was grounded and the all the cabling was wrapped in weather proofing
   tape as suggested in the documentation.

** Configuration
   Only one thing was changed in the Proxim wireless configuration from a
   standard factory installation and that is the Channel was changed to 140
   from 160.
  
* MorningStar Charge Controller
** Configuration
   Set the DIP switches to force 12V mode and to enable ModBus. All other defaults are acceptable.
* Obsidian Accelerometer
** Hardware
   See design files for mounting information.
** Configuration
   See repository for an export of the configuation.
